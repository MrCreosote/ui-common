                These Featured Narratives demonstrate some of the types of systems biology questions that can be explored in KBase. The datasets, analyses, and thought processes underlying these computational experiments are captured in the form of an interactive reproducible publication called a Narrative. Click on one of the Featured Narratives to open a read-only version that has already been populated with a summary, input datasets, and output from KBase services that have been run on the input data. </p>

<p>If you'd like to run the steps in these Narratives yourself, or even change them, you can make your own copy of a Narrative. Click on a Narrative name to open it, and then follow the <a href="http://kbase.us/get-started/narrative-quick-start/#copynarrative">instructions here</a> to copy it to your workspace.

         <!--   <p><b>New Featured Narratives Are Coming Soon!</b></p>
<p>KBase is currently undergoing a major update. New featured narratives are being developed and will appear here soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can explore public narratives and narratives that have been shared with you via the tabs to the left. (Tip: Sign in to view the "Mine" and "Shared With Me" tabs.)</p>
You can also build your own narrative! The <a href="http://kbase.us/for-users/narrative-quick-start/">Narrative Quick Start</a> guide, which describes how to create and run narratives, can be found <a href="http://kbase.us/for-users/narrative-quick-start/">here</a>.
